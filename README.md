# Project Automation Script

This Python script automates the packaging and processing of a web development project by performing the following tasks:

1. **Zips the Entire Project Folder**: Creates a zip file of the entire project directory with a `-full` suffix.

2. **Captures a Screenshot**: Takes a screenshot of the `index.html` file and saves it in the same directory.

3. **Zips the Image Folder**: Compresses the `image` folder within the project into a zip file with a `-assets` suffix.

4. **Converts HTML and CSS to Text Files**: Converts the `index.html` and `style.css` files to `.txt` format and saves them with appropriate names.

5. **Organizes Generated Files**: Moves all the generated files into an `Output` folder within the project directory.

This script is designed to streamline project delivery and archiving, ensuring that all necessary files are neatly packaged and easily accessible.
